  _note: 'One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on
    a saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the
    target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls
    the body but doesn''t deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can''t be targeted
    by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains
    its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed
    and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target''s statistics, but doesn''t
    gain access to the target''s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

    The
    possession lasts.'

      space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
      for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
