  _note: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the
    cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the
    cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to
    breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this
    attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker
    can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the
    target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength
    check.

  _note: 'The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it
    isn''t in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting
    position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one.
    If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

    Whenever
    any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate
    remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker
    or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if
    it can''t see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

    A duplicate has
    the cloaker''s AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate,
    or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the
    duplicate disappears.'
