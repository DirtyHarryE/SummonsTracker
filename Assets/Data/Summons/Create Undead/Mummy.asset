  _note: The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target
    can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this
    magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target
    fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration.
    A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of
    all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  _note: If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving
    throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points,
    and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse.
    If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and
    its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell
    or other magic.
