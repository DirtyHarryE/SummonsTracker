  _note: "The spectator shoots up to two of the following magical eye rays at one
    or two creatures it can see within 90 feet of it. It can use each ray only once
    on a turn.\n\r\nConfusion Ray. The target must succeed on a saving throw, or
    it can\u2019t take reactions until the end of its next turn. On its turn, the
    target can\u2019t move, and it uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack
    against a randomly determined creature within range. If the target can\u2019t
    attack, it does nothing on its turn.\r\nParalyzing Ray. The target must succeed
    on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target
    can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
    on itself on a success.\r\nFear Ray. The target must succeed on a saving throw
    or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the
    end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the
    target, ending the effect on itself on a success.\r\nWounding Ray. The target
    must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw."
